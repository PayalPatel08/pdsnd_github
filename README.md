### Basic Data  Exploration with pandas on Bikeshare Data
Basic Udacity project using pandas library in python for their bikeshare data exploration.

### Project Overview:
This project focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistic methods to perform an analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, New York City, Washington City - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

#### Requirements :
* You should have Python3, Numpy and pandas installed using anaconda
* A text editor, like Atom, VS code
* A terminal application

### Program Details:
The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an "all" option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an "all" option).

Receiving the user input, the program prints the following details:

* Most popular month
* Most popular day
* Most popular hour
* Most popular start station
* Most popular end station
* Most popular combination of start and end station
* Total travel duration
* Average travel duration
* Types of users by number
* Types of users by gender
* The oldest user
* The youngest user
* The most common birth year amongst user

After printing statistic, it goes ahead and ask user if they wants to view some raw data (5 rows of data) or not.

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.
